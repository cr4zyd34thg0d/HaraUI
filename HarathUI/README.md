## 🤔 What Is This Thing?

HarathUI is a modular quality-of-life addon that quietly replaces the bits of Blizzard's UI that made you go "ugh" 😩 with bits that make you go "ooh" 😍. It's not trying to be ElvUI. It's not trying to replace your action bars. It just wants to make your XP bar smarter, your cast bar prettier, and your loot toasts less... aggressive.

Think of it as a UI spa day. 🧖‍♀️✨

## 🧩 The Modules

### 📊 XP & Reputation Bar
*The smart bar that knows when to shut up.*

- 📈 Shows XP while leveling (obviously)
- 🎯 At max level? Only shows rep **if you're actually tracking one**
- 🙈 Otherwise it politely hides itself like a good UI element
- 😴 Tracks rested XP, quest XP bonuses, and session progress
- 🖱️ Fully moveable and resizable

### 🎬 Cast Bar
*Blizzard's cast bar, but make it fashion.* 💅

- ✨ Clean, modern design with square icon crop
- 👀 Preview mode when unlocked (no more "am I casting?" confusion)
- 📝 Text always renders on top (revolutionary, we know)
- 🔄 Replaces the default player cast bar entirely

### 🎁 Loot Toasts
*Because you deserve to know what dropped.* 💰

- 🎒 Shows items, money, AND currency (toggleable)
- 🤫 Less intrusive than the default Blizzard toasts
- 📋 Actually tells you useful information

### 📐 Smaller Game Menu
*For when ESC gives you too much menu.*

- 🔍 Scales down the main game menu
- 🖼️ More screen real estate for... looking at your transmog

### 👥 Friendly Nameplates
*Quick toggle for friendly nameplate visibility.*

- 🔥 Great for raids where you need to see who's standing in fire
- 🙈 Also great for when you don't want to see who's standing in fire

### 🗺️ Minimap Button Bar
*Corrals all those addon minimap buttons.* 🐑

- 🧹 Keeps your minimap clean
- 👆 All buttons still accessible
- ✨ Marie Kondo would approve

### 🔮 Rotation Helper
*(Work in progress)* 🚧

- 💡 Visual hints for your rotation
- 🆘 Because sometimes we all need a little help
